# number-summary
A small program to calculate sum, mean, and track positives/negatives from user input.

This was one of the first programs I wrote where several pieces of Python started to click. It includes a while loop, conditionals, math, and user input â€” and it was one of the first times I felt *truly proud* of writing something that worked.

Built during my learning journey in the University of Helsinki Python MOOC.
